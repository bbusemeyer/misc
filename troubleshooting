Problem: Audacity records audio too slow.

Problem is with the sound card? Changing to pulse audio for recording
and playback solves the problem.

# To get vim to stop messing with python files:

mkdir ~/.vim/after/ftplugin
echo "setlocal softtabstop=2" >> ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/python.vim
echo "setlocal tabstop=2" >> ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/python.vim
echo "setlocal shiftwidth=2" >> ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/python.vim

# .vim/after keeps all scripts that get loaded last, after all other scripts are loaded.


# Old:
# remove expandtab, etc. line from /usr/share/vim/vim74/ftplugin/python.vim

Get globus to allow a directory:

(1) Use the GUI and look over the options.
(2) Command line: you must configure the ~/.globusonline/lta/config-paths file.

This file is a plain text file, with each line corresponding to the
configuration of a particular directory path you wish to make accessible

By default, a ~/.globusonline/lta/config-paths file that looks like this will be
generated the first time Globus Connect Personal for Linux is run:

~/,0,1

This configuration tells Globus Connect Personal to make the user’s home
directory accessible, and to make it read/write in terms of the ability to do
Globus transfers. If we wanted to configure the user’s home directory to be read
only with respect to the ability to do Globus transfers we could change
config-paths like so: 

~/,0,0

If the user wishes to make additional directories accessible, then each new top
level path must be given its own line in the ~/.globusonline/lta/config-paths
file. For example, if the user wanted to enable Globus Connect Personal to
access the /data/tables directory then they would add the following line to
their config-paths file:

/data/tables,0,1

After making a change to the ~/.globusonline/lta/config-paths file you must stop
and restart Globus Connect Personal like so before the changes will take effect:

./globusconnectpersonal -stop

./globusconnectpersonal -start &

git pull a new branch to a new branch.

Getting two python versions to work on various things.

Just install everything with python3, and use anaconda2 to get a second set of
executibles seperate from python3, such as pip. Call these pip2, etc. and use
these to install python2 libraries and such.

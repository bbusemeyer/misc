vim doens't highlight things correctly anymore.

https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/416030/how-do-i-make-vim-highlight-math-properly-in-the-align-environment

Sometime around 2017 (I think), Dr. Chip decided that base-vim should only support syntax highlighting for base-latex. It is necessary to add in support for syntax highlighting for things available in latex packages (such as amsmath, which is what provides the align environment).

But this is very easy, and Dr. Chip includes syntax files for amsmath (and a few other packages) on his website.

In order to use these, you do the following. I will assume that you want to install additional highlighting to cover the align environment. As this comes from amsmath, we will add additional amsmath highlighting support. Then you

Get http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/vbafiles/amsmath.vba.gz from Dr. Chip
The file is in vimball format, and the easiest way to extract it is to open it with vim and follow instructions (which probably say :so %).
Move and rename amsmath.vba to ~/.vim/after/syntax/tex/amsmath.vim (or the corresponding location on your machine). One can also run :so % from amsmath.vba, this will automatically make ~/.vim/after/syntax/tex/amsmath.vim (and works if moving the amsmath.vba doesn't)
It is also possible to do this directly from your vimrc by making new "math zones" (and this is mostly what amsmath.vim does anyway). See :h tex-math for more.

Problem: Audacity records audio too slow.

Problem is with the sound card? Changing to pulse audio for recording
and playback solves the problem.

# To get vim to stop messing with python files:

mkdir ~/.vim/after/ftplugin
echo "setlocal softtabstop=2" >> ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/python.vim
echo "setlocal tabstop=2" >> ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/python.vim
echo "setlocal shiftwidth=2" >> ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/python.vim

# .vim/after keeps all scripts that get loaded last, after all other scripts are loaded.


# Old:
# remove expandtab, etc. line from /usr/share/vim/vim74/ftplugin/python.vim

Get globus to allow a directory:

(1) Use the GUI and look over the options.
(2) Command line: you must configure the ~/.globusonline/lta/config-paths file.

This file is a plain text file, with each line corresponding to the
configuration of a particular directory path you wish to make accessible

By default, a ~/.globusonline/lta/config-paths file that looks like this will be
generated the first time Globus Connect Personal for Linux is run:

~/,0,1

This configuration tells Globus Connect Personal to make the user’s home
directory accessible, and to make it read/write in terms of the ability to do
Globus transfers. If we wanted to configure the user’s home directory to be read
only with respect to the ability to do Globus transfers we could change
config-paths like so: 

~/,0,0

If the user wishes to make additional directories accessible, then each new top
level path must be given its own line in the ~/.globusonline/lta/config-paths
file. For example, if the user wanted to enable Globus Connect Personal to
access the /data/tables directory then they would add the following line to
their config-paths file:

/data/tables,0,1

After making a change to the ~/.globusonline/lta/config-paths file you must stop
and restart Globus Connect Personal like so before the changes will take effect:

./globusconnectpersonal -stop

./globusconnectpersonal -start &

Getting two python versions to work on various things.

Just install everything with python3, and use anaconda2 to get a second set of
executibles seperate from python3, such as pip. Call these pip2, etc. and use
these to install python2 libraries and such.

# A neat way to put an ISO on a USB

[From a tip on creating a Windows USB in Linux](https://www.addictivetips.com/ubuntu-linux-tips/how-to-create-windows-10-bootable-usb-on-linux/)

Use GParted to format to ext4 (Linux) or fat32 (windows, also safeest option).

Use
```
sudo mount -o loop ~/path/to/any.iso /mnt/
```
to mount the ISO. 

Copy all the files in /mnt into the USB.

Worked for Windows 10 on Kubuntu.
